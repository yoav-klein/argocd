# List Generator
---

The List generator is perhaps the simplest kind of generators. It lets you specify
a list of arbitrary parameters, and generates a Application for each element in the list.
You can do with these parameters whatever you want.

In this example we'll use the List generator to generate template parameters.
We'll define a list of paths, and use it in the `.source.path` part of the template.
